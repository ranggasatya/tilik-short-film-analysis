# tilik-short-film-analysis

Tilik is an Indonesian short film produced by Ravacana Films in collaboration with the Yogyakarta Special Region Cultural Service in 2018. This film became a hot topic of conversation in social media after its first broadcast on YouTube, Monday (17/8/2020).

This film itself tells about the culture of visiting in Javanese through the journey of women from a village in the Special Region of Yogyakarta. They are said to have gone to the city to visit the Village Head at the hospital. Due to the long distance in the city center, they had to take an open truck to get there.

Out of curiosity, I visualised some of the basic statistics based on the spread of the 'Tilik' keyword on Twitter from 17-19 of August 2020 when it was trending. To begin with, I scraped the tweets using Python's GetOldTweets3 library by Dmitry Mottl. After getting all the tweets and deleting the irrelevant ones, I started visualising the data and collecting some interesting insights. Some of the questions in my mind that I tried to find the answers through the analysis are:
- How many tweets containing the keyword were sent every hour?
- What are the most frequent words used in the tweets related with the topic?
- Were there specific hashtags and accounts which were frequently mentioned in the tweets?
- How are the overall public sentiment towards this particular trending topic?
